                Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
                Specific applications of AI include expert 
                systems, natural language processing ( NLP ), speech recognition and machine vision.
                Here is an image of an AI:

                The picture above shows how AI is similiar to humans in a way, and also, two ways that AI learn are through "deep learning" and "machine learning." 
                Both deep learning and machine learning are sub-fields of
                 artificial intelligence, and deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning. Deep learning is actually comprised of neural networks.
                  “Deep” in deep learning refers to a neural network comprised of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm.

            <h4>
                The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system.
                 But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined.
